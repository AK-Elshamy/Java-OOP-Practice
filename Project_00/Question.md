# Java OOP Student App

## Please create a simple Java application using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles that:

- #### **Accepts student data:** **id**, **name**, and **age** from the user.
- #### **Prints out the student information.**
- #### **Includes a basic validation:** ensure that the entered **age** is a positive integer greater than zero. If the input is invalid, prompt the user to enter the age again until a valid value is provided.
